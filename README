Introduction
============

This program provides a simple GUI to cover basic telephony use-cases. For
this purpose it makes use of the D-Bus API from oFono.

Additional scripts are also provided to achieve the following features:

1. Audio routing through PulseAudio Sound Server
2. Auto-connection of handsfree devices in BlueZ (HandsfreeGateway)


Dependencies
============

You will need Python, Qt4 and PyQt4 installed.

In order to use the dialer, oFono needs to be running. You can also use it
with any other component as long as it mimics the same API specification.

If you also want the audio to be routed appropriately, you might also be
interested in the provided utility scripts included with this component.
